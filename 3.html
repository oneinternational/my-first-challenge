<h2>my thoughts</h2>
I'm Sangho Park, and I've set to learn programing skills, <a href="https://finance.naver.com/" title="Naver Finance">especially HTML</a>.
<br>For me, It was a hard decision becasue 
<br>That age makes me restless and nervous, asking myself "isn't it too late for me to start and adventure something new"
<br>I really hope this decision will help me to get happy and to become wealthy in the future.
